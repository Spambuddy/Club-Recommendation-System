# Club-Recommendation-System
Club recommendation system for a social network. This program will recommend clubs a person may wish to join, based off of user data.

User data is stored in a text document for simplicity. The file is formatted as follows. The first line of each paragraph represents the individual's name. This is followed by the clubs this individual is already in (one club per line). This is followed by the names of the individual's friends. All names use the format of "LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME". Individuals are separated using newlines.
